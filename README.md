# Interactive-Data-Analysis-with-Plotly

Introduction:
In this project, I have explore data about flights in New York City (NYC) to understand more about flight delays. I have use Python to analyze the data and create interactive visualizations to make it easier to understand.

1. Understanding the Data:
The first step is to understand the data we're working with. We have information about flights, including details like departure delays, arrival delays, airlines, and origin airports.

2. Visualizing the Data:
To make sense of the data, I'll create graphs that show us different aspects of flight delays. We'll use histograms to see the distribution of delays and scatter plots to understand the relationship between departure and arrival delays.

3. Building Interactive Tools:
I have build interactive tools that allow us to explore the data in more detail. These tools will let us filter flights based on criteria like airline, month, and origin airport, so we can see how delays vary under different circumstances.

4. Creating Web Apps with Dash:
Using Dash, a Python framework for building web apps, I'll create two different web applications to visualize the data. These apps will allow us to interactively explore flight delays, giving us insights into which airlines and airports experience the most delays and when delays are most likely to occur.

5. Running the Applications:
Once my web apps are ready, I'll run this on my local machine, allowing to access them through a web browser. This will give us a user-friendly interface to explore the data and gain valuable insights into NYC flight delays.

Conclusion:
By analyzing NYC flight data and creating interactive visualizations, I've gained a better understanding of flight delays in the city. My web apps provide a user-friendly way to explore the data and uncover insights that can help airlines, airports, and travelers better manage and plan their flights.
